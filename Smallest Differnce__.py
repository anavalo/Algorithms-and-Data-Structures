'''Write a function that takes in two non-empty arrays of integers. The function should find the pair of numbers
(one form the first array, one from the second array) whose absolut differnce is closest to zero. The function should
return an array containing these two numbers, with the number from the first array in the first position. Assume that
there will be one pair of numbers with the smallest differnce.

Input: [-1,5,10,,20,28,3],[26,134,135,15,17]
Output: [28,26]
