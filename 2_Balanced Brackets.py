'''Write a function that takes in a string made up of brackets ("(", "[", "{", ")", "]", and "}")
and other optional characters. The function should return a boolean representing whether or not the
string is balanced in regards to brackets. A string is said to be balanced if it has as many opening
brackets of a given type as it has closing brackets of that type and if no bracket is unmatched.
Note that a closing bracket cannot match a corresponding opening bracket that comes after it.
Similarly, brackets cannot overlap each other as in "[(])".'''
