'''
Write a Binary Search Tree(BST) class. The class should have a 'value' property set to be an integer, as well as '"left"
and "right" properties, both of which should point to either the None (null) value or to another BST. A node is said
to be a BST node if and only if it satisfies the BST property: its value its strictly greater than the values of every
node to its left; its value is less or equal to the values of every node to its right; and both of its children nodes
are either BST nodes themselves or None(null) values. The BST class should support insertion, searching, and removal pf
values. The removal method should only remove the first instance of the target value.

        return self

    def contains(self, value):
